I am currently a PhD student in the National University of Singapore under the supervision of Professor Robby Tan . I obtained my Bachelors of Engineering (Mechatronics) from Singapore Institute of Technology/University of Glasgow in 2017 and a Masters of Technology (Intelligent Systems) from NUS-ISS in 2022. My research interest is in Computer Vision, with a focus on vision in adverse conditions such as night-time and rain.
