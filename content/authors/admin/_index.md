Hello, my name is Mikhail. I'm currently a 2nd year PhD student working on high-level Computer Vision at the [National University of Singapore (ECE)](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/) under the supervision of [Prof. Robby Tan](https://tanrobby.github.io/). My research revolves around domain adaptation and imbalanced classes, mainly in nighttime scenes. I'm also affliated with [I2R, A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r) under the supervision of [Dr. Wang Jian-Gang](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=kt0nCB0AAAAJ&hl=en).

Looking forward to meet like-minded researchers in various fields so don't hesitate to get in touch via any of my socials!
